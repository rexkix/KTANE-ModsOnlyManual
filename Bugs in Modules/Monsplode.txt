- Can you please log the button action as well as the button number?
Button number alone isn't really enough to do a good post-mortem
because sometimes the defuser doesn't give the actions out in order.

- vs. Zenlad move Sendify, was 2 but shouldn't it be 10 ?

- vs. Flaurim move Candle, was 1 but shouldn't it be 1.5 ?

- vs. Vallarim move Candle, was 1 but shouldn't it be 1.5 ?

*** I'm starting to think that Candle's damage is really 2 and not 3.

- vs Mebor move Hollow Gaze, was 4 but shouldn't it be 2 ?

- vs Gloorim move Appearify, was 4 but shouldn't it be 10 ?

- vs Nibs move Spectre, was 7 but shouldn't it be 0 ?
